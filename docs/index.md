# @Home

Welcome to the @Home competition documentation of [RoBorregos](https://roborregos.com), Robotics Representative Team of [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx). This documentation serves as a guide for our project, which focuses on researching and developing a multiproposal modular service robot for the [RoboCup@Home](https://athome.robocup.org/) competition. Our goal is to create a comprehensive software architecture that enables robots to perform various tasks that humans typically handle on a daily basis and adapting this software architecture in affordable hardware.

## About the Competition

The RoboCup@Home league is a part of the RoboCup initiative and is the largest annual competition for autonomous service robots. Its goal is to develop service and assistive robot technology for future domestic applications. The competition evaluates robots abilities in a realistic home environment through benchmark tests. 
The focus areas include: 

- Human-Robot Interaction
- Navigation and Mapping
- Computer Vision
- Object Manipulation
- System Integration
 
The RoboCup@Home competition is divided into two categories: the [Domestic Standard Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/34) (DSPL) and the [Open Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/14) (OPL). Our team competes in the Open Platform League.

In the [Open Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/14), we have the opportunity to explore and showcase our innovations and advancements without limitations on the choice of hardware platforms. This category allows us to push the boundaries of robotics and demonstrate our capabilities in a variety of areas.

## Project Objective

The main objective is to actively research, integrate and develop state-of-the-art technologies in the field of robotics. Through our participation in the RoboCup@Home competition's Open Platform League, we aim to demonstrate our knowledge, skills, and innovative thinking in developing advanced robotic systems. By leveraging cutting-edge hardware and software, we strive to push the boundaries of current technology and create innovative solutions for real-world problems.

Each year, in order to qualify for the international competition, the team has to upload a Team Description Paper with the most important scientific contributions during the last months.
