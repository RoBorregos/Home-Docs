# Mechanics

The mechanics area includes the integration of all the physical parts of the robot ensuring their proper position, it also takes care of the 3D model and URDF generation for the simulation of the robot.

The area is continuously researching and developing ways to improve the robot hardware, whether it is a more reliable gripper or trying to increase the height of the robot, among others.
