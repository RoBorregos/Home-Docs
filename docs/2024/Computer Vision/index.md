# Computer Vision

This module focuses on two main areas: Human Analysis and Object Detection, obtaining images from a Stereolabs ZED2. 

### Human Analysis
Several nodes were developed to cover the following main features:
- Face recognition
- Person tracking and re-identification
- Pose and action detection
- Person attributes and description
  
### Object Detection
The main objective for this year was the development of a robust pipeline to make datasets for training YOLO models, focusing on:
- Dataset generation
- Transform object detection datasets to segmentation datasets
