# Integration

Part of the efforts during this season was to transition from monolithic systems to horizontal scaling through the virtualization of each module. The use of containerization technologies, mainly Docker and NVIDIA-containers, enabled us to distribute the computational load and enhance the possibilities of using the developed nodes for other applications. The transition performed this year enhances development by standardizing the environment and allows more developers to build on top of the current infrastructure. Furthermore, this work helps us maintain granular control of the compute workload over the distributed system.
