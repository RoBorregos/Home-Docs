## 2025-07-02

**Done:**

- Install IR sensor on robot's gripper to detect object presence on Give Me a Hand task

**In progress:**

- Print new gripper pieces to correct post-processing issues


## 2025-06-25

- Continue research about the elevator implementation
- Faulty gripper post-processing, it ended up looking worse


## 2025-04-24 --> 2025-06-18

- Succesful gripper performance on TMR
- Onboarding session with new members
- Started research and discussions about the development of an elevator to enhance the robot reach
- Started gripper post-processing on 3D printed parts as trying to enhance aesthetics and giving it a more professional look

## 2025-04-17

**Holiday season**

## 2025-04-10

**Done:**

- Finish CAD
- Buy acrylic sheets
- Meeting with Dr. Erick to talk about gripper research paper

## 2025-04-03

**Done:**

- Finish main aluminum profile structure to increase the height of the xArm and to add more support points in the DashGo to avoid the robot overturn.
- Add tags to the robot voltmeters and switches.
- Meeting with Dr. Enrique Cuan for possible research paper collaboration.

**In progress:**

- Fix gripper design to operate to the servo range from 0 to 120Â° due to an error in our specific servo unit.
- Reprint gripper pieces with the aforementioned fix.
- Test the improvements of the new structure and do fixes accordingly.
- Finish new Robot cover design to comply with the new structure.
