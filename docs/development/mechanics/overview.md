The mechanics team is in charge of the integration of the main two parts of our robot, composed of a xArm6 on top of a DashGo Dobot AMR (see Hardware Overview for more specifications). 

The team aims to increase the robot sturdiness, aesthetics, user friendliness and is currently developing a custom parallel gripper for the robot, being able to grasp the objects of the competition and give feedback to it.
