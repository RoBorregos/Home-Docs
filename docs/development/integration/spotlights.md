- Linters, precommit, conventional commits.
- Script to check if needed topics, services, and action servers are available.
- Implement network tests (https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/ROS2-Tracing-Trace-and-Analyze.html).
- Consider using docker compose for an easier initialization of gRPC client/servers.
