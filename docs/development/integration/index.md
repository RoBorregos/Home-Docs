### Agreements:

- Migration to ROS2, conduct workshops, and standardize.
- PM by task. Each integration member follows up on a task.

  - Carry my luggage: Diego
  - GPSR: Oscar
  - Receptionist: Ale
  - Stickler to the rules: Gilberto
  - Breakfast: Fregoso
  - Storing groceries: Ivan
  - Restaurant: Ale

- Conduct tests with gRPC to integrate specific containers.
- Docker compose: standardize and replace Makefiles with individual dockers (Makefiles could be used but for docker compose).
- Use a monorepo: submodules and interfaces are too cumbersome. A similar structure can be maintained to avoid compiling all packages but as before.
- Continue with the implementation of the new state machine, and possibly research how other top teams or SOTA do it.
- Simulation: check possibilities after migrating to ROS2.

### To-do items:

- [ ] Each person breaks down the activities involved in completing a task.
- [x] Create a Gantt chart of general integration tasks.
