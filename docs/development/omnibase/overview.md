This section records the development of a holonomic base, a major hardware upgrade that aims to replace the currently in use Dash Go diferential base.

The change aims to increment the robot versatility to navigate though its environment as well as to be a more feasible and sturdy base for the robot in general, as being completely developed by the team accordingly to the competence specific needs. 


This section documents the design and implementation of a new holonomic base for the robot, a significant hardware upgrade intended to replace the currently used DashGo differential drive platform.

The motivation behind this transition is to greatly enhance the robot's mobility and versatility when navigating complex indoor environments as omnidirectional movement, enables smoother and more precise maneuvers, especially in tight or dynamic spaces.

As a fully custom-made solution developed entirely by the team, this upgrade empowers the team with full control over the mechanical and electronic architecture of the platform, facilitating future improvements, experimentation and a design that is tailored to meet the specific challenges and requirements for the competition.
