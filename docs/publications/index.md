# Overview

Welcome to the RoBorregos @Home publications section. Here you can find academic papers, conference proceedings, and research work produced by our team members related to robotics, service robots, and RoboCup@Home competition.

## Research Areas

Our research focuses on several key areas in service robotics:

- **Task Planning and Natural Language Processing**: Using LLMs and parsing techniques for reliable robot task planning
- **Digital Twins**: Implementation of digital twins for mobile and collaborative robot scenarios
- **Robotic Education**: Technology to support discrete event control teaching and robotics education
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Improving communication and interaction between humans and service robots
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, recognition, and scene understanding for domestic environments
